# Chess
Here is my implementation of the classical chess game implemented in C++ with graphics made in SDL2. 

Necessary SDL2 modules can be installed with:
  - `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev`
  - `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev`
  - `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev`

The main core of the application is done, but I am still working on development of some additional features and fixing some small bugs. 

To run the application you have to use commands in terminal from the main directory in which you can find Makefile. 
- Firts compile it with either "make", "make all" or "make compile"
- Then run it with "make run".

You can create the full documentation by using command in terminal "make doc". This documentation use Doxygen format.

To erase all files created by any of Makefile's command you can use command "make clean".
