# ChessCpp
Here is my implementation of the classical chess game in C++. 

The main core of the application is done, but I am still working on development of some additional features and fixing some small bugs. 

To run the application you have to use commands in terminal from the main directory in which you can find Makefile. 
- Firts compile it with either "make", "make all" or "make compile" and 
- Then run it with "make run".
